    <h1> welcome in :)</h1>
    <p> im jade and i am currently a third year computer science major at georia tech with 
        focuses are media and people. im not sure exactly where i went to go with my degree, but i know
        i want to take it as creative as i can go. im really interested in ui/ux design and game development though.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> i've struggled alot with imposter syndrome since coming to tech, because of this i didn't get involved the way i should've from the start. 
        this past semester, i forced myself into uncomfortable situations (actively participated in a club and work on things im not fully confident in lol)
        and  managed to do alot. i completed the bits of good design bootcamp and worked on a game with the tech vg dev club!   
    </p>
