      <p class="project-description">
        This was my design case study project for the Bits Of Good Design
        Bootcamp. My partner and I chose to address the issues faced by
        international students at Georgia Tech by designing an extension to the
        Office of International Education website. Our goals were to streamline
        communication between students and the Office Of International Education 
        as well as having organized, relevent information. 
        In addition, allowing students to connect this other international students
        easily to create a network of support.

          <p class="cap">We started initailly with conducting primary and secondary
            research to brainstorm issues faced by international students. We then met 
            with 3 student to ask questions about their expierences and where they felt 
            they had not been given enough assistance.

          <p class="cap">After interviews, we finally got into designing our application, we realized
            quickly we had wayyy too many features we were trying to implement that were not feasible.
            We finally narrowed it down to 3 key frames, a home, information, and forums pages.

          <p class="cap">We determined it would be the most accessible if it were an extension to the OIE website 
            where it would be easy to find and be more credible as a information source than a third party site.
            Over 30 components later we had our high fidelity designs done and prototyped.
