    <p id="bio"> <mark id="txt">im jade and i am currently a third year computer science major at georia tech with 
        focuses in media and people.<br> im not sure exactly where i went to go with my degree, but i know
        i want to take it as creative as i can go.<br>
        i am particularly interested in ui/ux design,i want to create curated and fun designs to empower local business and community. 
    <br>
         i've struggled alot with adjusting since coming to tech,<br>
        because of this i didn't get involved the way i should've from the start. 
        this past semester,<br> i forced myself into uncomfortable situations (actively participated in a club and work on things im not fully confident in lol)<br>
        and managed to do alot. i completed the bits of good design bootcamp and worked on a game with the tech vg dev club! 
        i also made this website in straight html/css :)  this page specifically is 
        inspired by the <a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/">yale school of art website </a>

        in my free time, im a bit of a hobby collecter. drawing will always be my first love (favorite mediums being watercolor and ink), but i also constantly making things in my room like the hermit i am.
        i make jewelry, throw pottery, and currently i am learning blender! in the rare occasion i leave my room im probably rollerskating, walking my dogs, or going on a hike.
